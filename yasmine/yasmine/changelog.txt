# Change log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


##[0.3.0] - 2016-09-16

### Added
• changelog.txt. It contains the changelog for the yasmine library
• assembly.h. It contains macros used for different tasks like creating the lambda wrappers for behaviors and guards (constraints)
• overloaded methods for adding transitions into state machine: different combinations of parameters for kind, guard and behavior
• priority for events and event priority processing in the state machine
• yasmine's interpretation of the choice pseudostate. The choice allows only one default outgoing transition (a transition with no guard).
• 'noexcept' for all destructors
• log macro Y_LOG_HEX for logging hex editor style messages
• get_name method for events. It returns the ID of the event as a string if not overloaded
• event_template.hpp containing macros to created event_impl sub classes with fixed ID and priority (EVENT_WITH_ID, EVENT_WITH_ID_PRIORITY)

### Changed
•The extension of the headers is now .hpp instead of .h.
• Both the synchronous and asynchronous state machines use "start_state_machine" and "stop_state_machine" methods to start and stop the state machines.
• "start_state_machine" will return now true if the state machine was started and is running and false if a terminate pseudostate was reached or the state machine encountered a problem and is shutting down. Before the opposite was true.
• COMPLETION_EVENT will now have the maximum value of event_id (std::uint32_t -> 4.294.967.295 or 0xFFFFFFFF) instead of 0
• simple state and asynchronous simple state store an error event instead of a behavior exception
• Defects of the state machine will not be stored in the free store anymore. A copy of the object is stored instead.
• event's 'create_event' is now called 'create'
• constraint's (guard's) 'create_constraint' is now called 'create'

• code improvements (e.g. reference instead of pointer in signature of async_behavior::run)

• Removed the name parameter from transition and implicitly from state_machine::add_transition. A generated transition name can be retrieved by calling get_name()

### Fixed
• improved texts and log levels of logging calls
• The forward declaration headers of classes are now consistently included in the header of the corresponding class. Thus duplicated included headers could be removed
• 'event_priority = std::int8_t' instead of 'event_priority = int8_t'
• Problem with the URI of the state machine elements. Now, the URI contains all the element's ancestors
